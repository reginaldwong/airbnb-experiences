# Airbnb Experiences Page

This is a React-based Airbnb Experiences page. The page features a navigation bar, a hero section, a list of experiences, and a footer.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, run npm start to start the development server and open the page in your browser.

## File Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
App.js
App.css
components/
|-- Navbar.js
|-- Hero.js
|-- Card.js
|-- Footer.js
data/
|-- data.js
```
- The App.js file is the main component of the page and contains the logic for rendering the different components and experience cards.

- The components/ directory contains the components that make up the page, including the navigation bar, hero section, experience cards, and footer.

- The data/ directory contains the data for the experiences that are displayed on the page.

## Components
The different components of the page are described below:

## Navbar
The Navbar component is responsible for rendering the navigation bar at the top of the page.

## Hero
The Hero component is responsible for rendering the hero section of the page.

## Card
The Card component is responsible for rendering the individual experience cards. It takes in the experience data as a prop and displays the relevant information for each experience.

## Footer
The Footer component is responsible for rendering the footer of the page.

## Data
The data for the experiences is stored in the data.js file in the data/ directory. The data is passed as props to the Card component and used to display the relevant information for each experience.

## Deployment
To deploy the page, run `npm run` build to create a production build of the page. The production build can then be served using a static file server or deployed to a hosting platform.
